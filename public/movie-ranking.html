<h1> The Best movies or series according to Mike Donnovich</h1>
<h2>The top 3 movies or series of 2024</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Blue Eyed Samurai</h3>
<p>This is a series from NEtflix, and its going to blow your mind. <br/>
    The series has recently been added on 2024. And is now one of the Top. <br/>  
    It was beyong amazing and a master piece. very entertaining, <br/>
    its very gory and full of violence but its a great series</p>
<h3> 300</h3>
<p>Interestingly enough for some strange reason; <br/>
     this movie has been seen by many people like a joke or satire.<br/>
     but quite frankly I love this movie because it teaches you ,<br/>
     the old ways of the Spartan warriors and soldiers. <br/>
     though the director who is Jack Snyder in the movie,<br/>
     tends to exagerate the precise events by making a little hyperbole <br/>
     in the movie, by adding more actions and cgi to the scenes. however,<br/>
     its a great movie about war and brotherhood from the ancient Greeks. </p>
     <h3>Kindom of Heaven</h3>
     <p>now this movie is about the crusades in Jerusalem around 1250,
         it has a lot of horrific scenes regarding those times. 
         but overall its a wonderful movie to enjoy
        , it has love, passion, and the human greed, epic battles.  </p>
